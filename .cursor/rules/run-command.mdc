# Run Command Rule

- Always use `.\stealth-run.bat` to run this project on Windows
- Use `./stealth-run.sh` on Mac/Linux environments
- These commands will:
  - Create required directories
  - Clean previous builds
  - Build the application
  - Launch the app in stealth mode (invisible)
- Remember the app runs invisibly by default - use Ctrl+B (or Cmd+B on Mac) to toggle visibility
